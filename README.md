# ChromeExtension_javascript_ROOT_ReadOnlyOneTime

I have developped that tool in winter 2015.

My objective was to sell it as a fremium tool to lawyers to speed-up their work when they search information with a web browser in private law databases.

I realized that lawyers have really big needs for technical tools, but they are not ready to pay a few boxes for them.

So my tool is currently on the Chrome Web Store, at  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/root, but I don't maintain it anymore.

This project has permited me to loearn a lot on the following aspects:

	-HTML DOM search and manipulation via javascript
	
	-Chrome Dev Tools
	
	-Safari Dev Tools
	
	-Few web source editors and tools
	
	-Chrome Extension creation (manifest, json format)
	
	-Publication process on Chrome Web Store
